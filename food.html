		<p>so this one time back in, oh, 2012 or 2013 â€” my second year of undergraduate studies at university, i jokingly batted around a comment or two with my housemates at the time that i should make a food blog. i was cruising academically at the time. my course-load was mainly intro to psych stuff required for my major (stats, brain and behaviour, abnormal psych...) sprinkled with... uh... *digs back through 'Second Year' school folder*. right. pharm and physiology. and linguistics. can't forget linguistics. suffice to say i didn't go to much class (ling was in mac-cor(r?)y for christsake! who even goes there!?). if there was a girl i liked in one, maybe i'd be bothered, but i generally couldn't be bothered.
			<br>
			<br>
			so i cooked. a lot. and slowly (i'm talking scrambled eggs which aught to take half-an-hour, <em>minimum</em>, of egg-to-pan cook time here). at some point there i had enough free time that somewhere in between the four hours of cooking and baking i would do each day, i would go to the gym twice. when i did go to the library... well, finding some of these pictures reminded me I have a screenshot of when i <em>finally</em> beat the chess.com on easy. i have no doubt that i spent more time in my second year in the kitchen than i did in class+library combined.
			<br>
			<br>
			so i cooked, and i baked, and i took a picture every once in a while. my housemates probably remember the baking. i remember that one time i said i should just make a food blog considering all i was doing all day. screw the food blog idea, that's waaaaaay too much work. y'all are just going to get the photos. that's all this is. a page of my food photos. mmmmmmmm.

			<p>these are the few i could dig up from those formative years. hello from undergrad foodie me: </p>
