I

My first tattoo was done with a desire to express permanence of what, to me, is exactly that - a permanent axiom, stead-fast in my mind. Let my body mirror my mind, I suppose in a sense.

I've never thought that I wanted another... It simply never entered my mind that there was something else I wanted to mirror in that way.

So..., recently I awoke with some unexplained burns and bruises. To those who know me, this is not entirely a unbeknownst occurrence, and in of itself isn't of much note.

The burns though, sparked something. For sure. A second tattoo.

As it stands, the specifics of it are *far* from forming any sort of coherent final THIS IS WHAT IS GOING ONTO MY BODY FOREVER. But the idea is there, in the not-quite touching, side-by-side, small little circles resembling that ubiquitous âˆž of infinity which I have fading on my left bicep.

I like it. Aesthetically, I can feel it shaping into something with a bit of bad-ass and mystery (this is a tattoo on my arm for fucks sake! it better have some bad-assery to it!). That's a bit of a contrast with my other tattoo, which, is somewhat conservative in a sense - a classic, capital "L" Latin-style word, nicely serifed and all. And that seems appropriate to me. My mind SCREAMS at the thought of having what I am considering put to ink be done in some stuffy and formal *serifed* manner.
